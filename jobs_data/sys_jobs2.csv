An FMS is a specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern transport aircraft no longer need to carry flight engineers or navigators. The FMS provides and/or automates Flight Planning, Datalink, Guidance, Navigation, Performance and Thrust Management functions. As an FMS specialist, you will work under the guidance of experienced engineers to understand and operate the FMS, review and develop FMS functional and performance requirements, test, verify & validate the FMS, document, review and resolve system issues/bugs, conduct re-tests, understand and identify potential safety issues, non-conformances, and directly support and participate in development, test and certification activities. You can expect to interface with engineers from all FMS functions, engineers in multiple disciplines such as hardware, software, interfacing airplane systems such as airplane displays, flight control computers, auto throttle, communications management (HF/VHF/SATCOM), navigation systems (GPS, inertial, radio), Engine Controls, Stall Management, Weather Radar, Ground Proximity Warning System and even the in-flight entertainment system! You will work directly with a global, multicultural team of engineers as well as pilots, airline customers, suppliers, regulators, internal stakeholders such as lab operations, flight operations, logistics, financial operations, features strategy, various business units and leadership for all Boeing commercial and military airplane programs. You will conduct testing at Boeing airplane systems laboratories which house airplane simulators as well as at Boeing Field to support flight tests. Domestic and international travel may be required to support activities such as airplane customer visits, airshows and flight tests. You may even be asked to support exotic activities such as flight tests to the Polar Regions and to remote locations anywhere in the world. On the FMS team, we believe the best way to learn about the FMS is to interact with and operate it. The Flight Management System is the primary interface of the crew with cockpit systems in order to perform its mission. Therefore, to develop and test the system means to perform pilot operations, think like a pilot, test in our virtual simulators, on our system test benches, airplane simulators and participate in flight tests where you can see and “feel” the FMS fly the airplane. Position Responsibilities: Develop and validate hardware and software system functional and software requirements Support the design of hardware, software and interface specifications Tests and validates to ensure system designs meet operational and functional requirements Develop tests to evaluate system Monitors supplier performance to ensure system integration and compliance with requirements Solves problems concerning fielded hardware and software over the entire product lifecycle Researches specific technology advances for potential application to company business needs Basic Qualifications (Required Skills/Experience): Bachelor’s degree or higher in an ABET accredited course of study in engineering, computer science or related field. 3+ years of experience in Avionics engineering. Preferred Qualifications (Desired Skills/Experience): Bachelor’s Degree or higher from an accredited course of study in electrical, aerospace and computer engineering is preferred.
