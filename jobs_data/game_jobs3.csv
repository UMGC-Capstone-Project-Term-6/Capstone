These youth have traditionally been stranded in hospital settings long after being medically cleared for release due to lack of beds available at behavioral health or psychiatric providers.What is this company? Board of who? We would agree with you that our name is not the greatest and we hope to change it in the near future! The Board of Child Care is not a federal or state agency.

Play games, facilitate getting calls or video visits set up with their families or other stakeholders, etc. Ensure the kids are dressed in weather and activity-appropriate clothing. Generally, during your shift, you'll always spend a little time outside (weather permitting), like throwing a football around or taking a therapeutic walk around campus. While the kids are asleep you would: Complete bed checks for every resident every fifteen minutes. Finish any laundry and cleaning tasks to get ready for the next day.  Generally, as a part of the team you will: Complete a unit inspection checklist (all shifts perform this task) to make sure everything is working, supplies are stocked, and generally, the space is safe and well-lit. Rotate in the on-call coverage schedule. Foster an atmosphere of collaborative problem-solving among residents and co-workers. Provide good notes to the incoming shift so they are aware of what has been working well and what they should be mindful of.

As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed. Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you. A day in the life: This role is hands-on across all areas as a data scientist; from understanding customer requirements and collecting data, to developing visualizations and advanced analytics to make data-driven recommendations and decisions. You will work directly with intel analysts to develop prototypes and novel solutions that satisfy complex operational needs. What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. All of our data scientists need the following skills: Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list. A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects. For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects. For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. For this particular role, you will also need: Large dataset experience Strong familiarity with data science applications such as association analysis, graph/network analytics, clustering, text analytics, classification and regression (multivariate and logistic). Training in the design and implementation of static and dynamic visualizations in R, Python, Tableau, or similar visualization software. These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory: Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Experience or exposure to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding) Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React Why Red Alpha? Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight. Some of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid floating holidays. You can stay at your best: As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family. Free access to a fully equipped state of the art gym! $300 per year in company branded merchandise (Under Armour, Nike, Carhartt, YETI, etc.) Fun events throughout the year including a holiday gala, whisky tastings, fall festivals, happy hours, and more."
